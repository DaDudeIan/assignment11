Base case:
fact(1) = 1:
n > i thus it returns 1.

Inductive step:
Assume true for some k > 1 
fact(k) = k * fact(k-1)

fact(k+1) = (k+1) * fact(k+1-1) = (k+1) * fact(k) 







         

/*
Since we know that fact(1) is true, then the function will always find the factorial,
because no matter what, the program will hit our base case. Thus proving it works for
every value of n as input.
