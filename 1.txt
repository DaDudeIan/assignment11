Base case:
fact(1) = 1:
n > i thus it returns 1.

Suppose fact() has been given input 2
It will return:
        2 * fact(2-1)
    =   2 * fact(1)

We already proved that fact(1) = 1 so:
    2 * fact(1) = 2 * 1 = 2

Inductive step:
Assume true for some k > 1 
fact(k) = k * fact(k-1)

Suppose k = 3.
Then fact(3) is correct if fact(2) is correct.
fact(2) is correct if fact(1) is correct.
We have already proven that fact(1) is correct. 
Therefore fact(2) is correct, and fact(3) is correct.







         

/*
Since we know that fact(1) is true, then the function will always find the factorial,
because no matter what, the program will hit our base case. Thus proving it works for
every value of n as input.
